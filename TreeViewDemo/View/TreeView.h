#pragma mark *** Creating Instances ***

/* Initializes a new TreeView instance.  (TreeView's designated initializer is the same as NSView's: -initWithFrame:.)  The TreeView has default appearance properties and layout metrics, but to have a usable TreeView with actual content, you need to specify a nodeViewNibName, an optional nodeViewNibBundle, and a modelRoot.
*/

#pragma mark *** Connection to Model ***

/* The root of the model node tree that the TreeView is being asked to display.  (The modelRoot may have ancestor nodes, but TreeView will ignore them and treat modelRoot as the root.)  May be set to nil, in which case the TreeView displays no content.  The modelRoot object, and all of its desdendants as discovered through recursive application of the "-childModelNodes" accessor to traverse the model tree, must conform to the TreeViewModelNode protocol declared in TreeViewModelNode.h
*/
@property(retain) id<TreeViewModelNode> modelRoot;


#pragma mark *** Root SubtreeView Access ***

/* A TreeView builds the tree it displays using recursively nested SubtreeView instances.  This read-only accessor provides a way to get the rootmost SubtreeView (the one that corresponds to the modelRoot model node).
*/
@property(readonly) SubtreeView *rootSubtreeView;


#pragma mark *** Node View Nib Specification ***

/* The name of the .nib file from which to instantiate node views.  (This API design assumes that all node views should be instantiated from the same .nib.  If a tree of heterogeneous nodes was desired, we could switch to a different mechanism for identifying the .nib to instantiate.)  Must specify a "View" .nib file, whose File's Owner is a SubtreeView, or the TreeView will be unable to instantiate node views.

/* The NSBundle from which the .nib named by nodeViewNibName can be loaded.  May be nil, in which case we follow the usual AppKit-implemented rules for automatically finding the named .nib file.
*/

#pragma mark *** Selection State ***

/* The unordered set of model nodes that are currently selected in the TreeView.  When no nodes are selected, this is an empty NSSet.  It will never be nil (and attempting to set it to nil will raise an exception).  Every member of this set must be a descendant of the TreeView's modelRoot (or modelRoot itself).  If any member is not, TreeView will raise an exception.

#pragma mark *** Node Hit-Testing ***

/* Returns the model node under the given point, which must be expressed in the TreeView's interior (bounds) coordinate space.  If there is a collapsed subtree at the given point, returns the model node at the root of the collapsed subtree.  If there is no model node at the given point, returns nil.
*/

#pragma mark *** Sizing and Layout ***

/* A TreeView's minimumFrameSize is the size needed to accommodate its content (as currently laid out) and margins.  Changes to the TreeView's content, layout, or margins will update this.  When a TreeView is the documentView of an NSScrollView, its actual frame may be larger than its minimumFrameSize, since we automatically expand the TreeView to always be at least as large as the NSScrollView's clip area (contentView) to provide a nicer user experience.
*/

/* If YES, and if the TreeView is the documentView of an NSScrollView, the TreeView will automatically resize itself as needed to ensure that it always at least fills the content area of its enclosing NSScrollView.  If NO, or if the TreeView is not the documentView of an NSScrollView, the TreeView's size is determined only by its content and margins.

/* Toggles the expansion state of the TreeView's selectedModelNodes, expanding those that are currently collapsed, and collapsing those that are currently expanded.
*/
- (IBAction)toggleExpansionOfSelectedModelNodes:(id)sender;

/* Returns the bounding box of the node views that represent the specified modelNodes.  Model nodes that aren't part of the displayed tree, or are part of a collapsed subtree, are ignored and don't contribute to the returned bounding box.  The bounding box takes only the specified nodes into account, disregarding any descendants they might have.

/* Does a [self scrollRectToVisible:] with the bounding box of the specified model nodes.

/* Does a [self scrollRectToVisible:] with the bounding box of the selected model nodes.

#pragma mark *** Animation Support ***

/* Whether the TreeView animates layout operations.  Defaults to YES.  If set to NO, layout jumpst instantaneously to the tree's new state.
*/
@property BOOL animatesLayout;

/* Used to temporarily suppress layout animation during event tracking.  Layout animation happens only if animatesLayout is YES and this is NO.
*/

#pragma mark *** Layout Metrics ***

/* The amount of padding to leave between the displayed tree and each of the four edges of the TreeView's bounds.
*/
