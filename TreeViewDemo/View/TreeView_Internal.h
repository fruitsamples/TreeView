#pragma mark *** ModelNode -> SubtreeView Relationship Management ***

/* Returns the SubtreeView that corresponds to the specified modelNode, as tracked by the TreeView's modelNodeToSubtreeViewMapTable.
*/
- (SubtreeView *)subtreeViewForModelNode:(id)modelNode;

/* Associates the specified subtreeView with the given modelNode in the TreeView's modelNodeToSubtreeViewMapTable, so that it can later be looked up using -subtreeViewForModelNode:.
*/

#pragma mark *** Model Tree Navigation ***

/* Returns YES if modelNode is a descendant of possibleAncestor, NO if not.  Raises an exception if either modelNode or possibleAncestor is nil.
*/
- (BOOL)modelNode:(id<TreeViewModelNode>)modelNode isDescendantOf:(id<TreeViewModelNode>)possibleAncestor;

/* Returns YES if modelNode is the TreeView's assigned modelRoot, or a descendant of modelRoot.  Returns NO if not.  TreeView uses this determination to avoid traversing nodes above its assigned modelRoot (if there are any).  Raises an exception if modelNode is nil.
*/
- (BOOL)modelNodeIsInAssignedTree:(id<TreeViewModelNode>)modelNode;

/* Returns the sibling at the given offset relative to the given modelNode.  (e.g. relativeIndex == -1 requests the previous sibling.  relativeIndex == +1 requests the next sibling.)  Returns nil if the modelNode has no sibling at the specified relativeIndex (resultant index out of bounds).  This method won't go above the subtree defined by the TreeView's modelRoot.  (That is: If the given modelNode is the TreeView's modelRoot, this method returns nil, even if the requested sibling exists.)  Raises an exception if modelNode is nil, or if modelNode is not within the subtree assigned to the TreeView.
*/

#pragma mark *** Node View Nib Caching ***

/* Returns an NSNib instance created from the TreeView's nodeViewNibName and nodeViewNibBundle.  We automatically let go of the cachedNodeViewNib when either of these properties changes.  Keeping a cached NSNib instance helps speed up repeated instantiation of node views.
