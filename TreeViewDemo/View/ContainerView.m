A srtroked NSBezierPath extends by half the path's line width to either side of the ideal path.  To produce rendered results that closely match those in layer-backed mode, since ContainerView is optimized to leverage CALayer's programmatic drawing capabilities when layer-backed, we need to inset the path we're going to stroke by half the border width.
